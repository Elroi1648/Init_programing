<h4> What is computer and its features?</h4>

<b>A computer</b> is a machine that can be programmed to manipulate symbols. Its principal characteristics are: It responds to <br> a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner. It can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).
 
<h4> how does a computer function?</h4>

Simply a computer is a  device that can <b>process</b> and <b>store data</b>. So in order to process <br> and store data the computer must receive data from the the user.  
<h3> input</h3>
input refers to any information, or data, that is <b>sent</b> to a computer for processing.
We basically<br> input information to the computer using text.
The input data is given by text.
Input is often sent to the computer from a device <br>such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input device.
Putting it simple, input is the act of entering data into a computer.
Once the data has <br>been entered into the computer it can be processed and whatever instruction that was commanded, can be carried out. 
<h3> Process</h3>
After the information is given by the user to the computer it needs to be processed.so <br>processing is an action of microprocessors in a computer performs to excute the input given by the user. <br>Process in other word means compute.
the word compute was first used in <br>the second world war.in project manhattan which was led by Richard Feynman the calculation of the project was calculated by <br>the wives of the scientists who participated in the project .so they used to call their action computing.so the wives were called <br>computers.so the computer must calculate the given data in order to give the an accurate output.
